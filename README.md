# **Extrac-Node-ABP**

```An app that makes it easier to recreate abps through json export. from fmodel it's still in a beta phase so if there is any error don't hesitate to tell me if you want to contribute to improving the app I am also willing to do it any help would be wonderful```

- # Steps to use the app 

  - **1-** Open Fmodel and look for the abp you want 
  - **2-** Export it in Json format. 
  - **3-** Open the app 
  - **4-** Next you can either drag the abp to the line that appears above or you can search for the abp from its browse JSON option
  - **5-** Select a folder where the extracted data will be saved for future reuse Select it in Select Folder 
  - **6-** press Generate TXT 
  - **7-** once executed it will read the abp and extract the nodes
  - **8-** once finished a box will appear with the name of the character and other data The nodes will auto-copy to your clipboard ready to paste them into the animation blueprint in unreal
  - **9-** also as I mentioned the data will be saved in a txt. so that you reuse it and don't do the process again Just open the txt. and copy everything that is there then paste it in the animation blueprint in unreal 

### **The app will look for each parameter of the nodes in the given abp it will scan it and adapt them into a format that unreal accepts It even extracts kawai nodes limits capsules** 

```The app has many ways to use it for example to cut time in the recreation of abps combining several kawai physics or other things```

> I hope it helps you and I hope for your support any problem let me know

The app is currently undergoing maintenance due to a Trojan alert. I will upload the app to GitHub so you can review the code and verify that the app is virus-free.
